# My Second Blog Post

Welcome to my second blog post! This is a test page to demonstrate markdown capabilities.

## Features

- Basic text formatting
- Lists (like this one)
- Headers
- Links

### Example Content

Here's some example content showing different markdown features:

1. **Bold text** and *italic text*
2. [A sample link](https://example.com)
3. > A blockquote for good measure

```javascript
// Even a code block
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

#### Conclusion

This is just a test page, but it shows the basic structure of a blog post in markdown.
